# Heart-disease-prediction_ML
# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project explores heart health datasets to uncover patterns and build predictive models for heart disease risk.  
The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and machine learning model development.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Datasets are linked directly in the Jupyter Notebook:
- Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset  
- Heart Analysis Data (GitHub)  

*(See `final_Project.ipynb` for dataset loading and references.)*

## Tools & Libraries
- Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn  
- Modeling: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM  

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
3. Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler  
4. Model building & evaluation (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree)  
5. Performance comparison & insights  

## Results
- Built multiple ML models to predict heart disease risk.  
- Identified key risk factors such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure.  
- Achieved high accuracy with KNN/SVM classifiers (~99%).
